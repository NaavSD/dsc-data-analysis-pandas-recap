# Data Analysis in Pandas - Recap

This short lesson summarizes the topics we covered in this section and why they'll be important to you as a data scientist.

## Key Takeaways

In this section, we spent time getting comfortable with pandas and getting some more practice with exploratory data analysis. Some of the key takeaways:

* For non-trivial datasets you'll usually want to store your data in pandas data structures rather than native Python lists and dictionaries 
* Pandas has a range of great features for easily importing data from anything from a CSV, an Excel file, JSON, SQL, or a Python dictionary  
* Pandas `Series` and `DataFrame` classes have a bunch of powerful methods for munging data 
* Pandas also has a range of methods for applying descriptive statistics to Series and DataFrames 
* Finally, by wrapping Matplotlib, Pandas also provides some very convenient plotting capabilities for quickly visualizing data 
* We also got some experience working with the Ames Housing dataset, and set up accounts on Kaggle - a really useful resource for practicing data scientists.
